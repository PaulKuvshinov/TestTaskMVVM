Task: You need to write an application that downloads a JSON file from the server, parses and displays a list sorted in descending order with a notification of active orders in a taxi service. Each item list should have:
- Starting address
- End address
- Travel date
- Order cost

The amount in the order cost is presented in the form of two fields: an integer number of kopecks (or other minimum units for other currencies) and a currency code according to ISO 4217.
By clicking on an element of the list, it is necessary to show a screen with details, where, in addition to the fields listed above, the time of the order, as well as information about the car and driver, should be displayed.
